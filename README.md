# LBRD-IC-Dataset (IEEE Transactions on Multimedia 2023)
The LBRD-IC consists of 10,100 videos, each of 10 seconds duration, which can be used in a
non-contact respiratory signal detection task using the thoracoabdominal region, with their 
corresponding true values in the "GroundTruth" folder, each corresponding value corresponding 
to the subject's average respiratory rate over 10 seconds in the video. Each corresponding 
value corresponds to the average respiration rate of the subject in the video over 10 seconds.

The age and gender table of the 17 subjects in the LBRD-IC dataset is shown in the below, which we will include in the dataset link page. It is worth noting that some patients were transferred to our hospital for data collection, so their age information was lost.
